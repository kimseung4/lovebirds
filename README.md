<h1>Lovebirds: A Messenger for Language Learning</h1>
<h2>Design document</h2>
<h3>Topic</h3>
<p>Language learning in a couple/group setting through a messenger.</p>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>21 century is a very fast-paced time. Everyone is busy. It’s hard to spare time for anything “extra”. Foreign language learning is a clear “extra”. It takes enormous amount of dedication to spare time and energy for that activity. That’s why language learning apps are so popular comparing to traditional face to face learning environments. We firmly believe that even that is usually perceived as extra work as well. There are also no apps that allow to learn a language in a group or couple setting. The research(REFERENCE) shows that if a couple takes on a certain activity together they are more likely to be more persistent/successful, so we suggest adding a language component into people’s daily digital behaviour - like messaging.</p>
<h3>Target Audience</h3>
<p>Couples 
In a long-distance relationship
In a traditional relationship 
With a different mother tongues
Friends:
That want to learn a language collaboratively</p>
<h3>User Stories</h3>
<p>Jessica is an American, who just took a year abroad and went travelling to Europe. She fell in love with Andre and they are serious about the future together. They still haven’t figured out where they will live or how will it all work out in the future. What Jessica is sure about is that she wants to learn French to understand Andre better, since that’s his mother tongue. She googles language learning options - both face to face and online and chooses Duolinguo since it’s the most popular product on the market. She uses it for some time, but finds it annoying that she need to screenshot every time she has a question and wants to ask Anrie, so she decides to look for an alternative, focusing on collaborative learning experience, that’s how she finds lovebirds. And that a perfect fit because she is learning the language in conjunction with her communication (messenger feature) to Andre, which brings them closer together.</p><br>
<p>Mike and Diana are Romanian citizens, married with adult kids, their son Jack moved to live with his wife in Canada. They recently had a son. Mike and Diana speak Romanian to their son, and he translates for his wife. But their grandson being brought up in an English speaking environment barely speaks any Romanian. Mike and Diana want to get to know the kid better and decide to learn English to communicate. They both take face to face traditional class, but have a lot of questions for their son to help them with. They ask the teacher for an advice and she recommends “lovebirds”, they install the messenger, convince their son to do the same and bombard him with questions and explanations. They are really satisfied with the product since they feel closer to son and they are also pursuing a bigger goal.</p><br>
